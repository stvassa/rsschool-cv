## About me
I started my work experience as a teacher, after that there were sales, finally found the area where I want to be - IT. 
Nowadays, I'm active learning programming and User Experience Design and the main goal of my training are creating simple, usable, cross-browser and adaptive-responsive websites. Try to use the most of opportunities of HTML and CSS to optimize the loading of the site.
My strengths are the ability and desire to learn, build own path and also adapt to new conditions.
My goal is to become a Senior Product Designer in a 3 years, with a focus on UX and with understanding the principles of development and, if necessary, writing the code (the front-end) on my own. 
That is why I get acquainted with related fields such as SEO and project management while there is such an opportunity. I believe that a professional should understand how colleagues work in order not to interfere and improve teamwork.
